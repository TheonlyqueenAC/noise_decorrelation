	title = {Neurocognitive Dysfunction in {HIV}-Infected Youth: Investigating the Relationship with Immune Activation},
	volume = {22},
	issn = {1359-6535, 2040-2058},
	url = {https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3851/IMP3157},
	doi = {10.3851/IMP3157},
	shorttitle = {Neurocognitive Dysfunction in {HIV}-Infected Youth},
	abstract = {Background
              {HIV}-infected individuals are at increased risk of neurocognitive impairment compared to the general population. Studies suggest that, despite combination antiretroviral therapy ({cART}), {HIV} infection causes immune activation which results in neural damage; however, few data exist in {HIV}-infected youth.
            
            
              Methods
              {HIV}-infected youth 8–26-years-old on {cART} with virological suppression were prospectively enrolled along with healthy controls. Neurocognitive performance was assessed by age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Soluble and cellular markers of T-lymphocyte and monocyte activation were measured by {ELISA} and flow cytometry, respectively.
            
            
              Results
              
                45 {HIV}-infected subjects and 21 controls were enrolled. Markers of T-cell and monocyte activation were higher in the {HIV}-infected subjects compared to controls, but proportions of inflammatory and patrolling monocytes were similar. Although there were no significant differences in neurocognitive scores between the {HIV}-infected and control groups, scores were low-average for four of five testing domains for the {HIV}-infected subjects and average for all five in the controls, and \% of {HIV}-infected subjects with scores classified as ‘low average’ or below was higher than in the controls. Variables most associated with neurocognitive performance among {HIV}-infected subjects included activated {CD}4
                +
                T-cells (\% {CD}4+{CD}38+{HLA}-{DR}), monocyte activation (soluble {CD}14), {HIV} duration, age and sex.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              {HIV}-infected youth on {cART} with virological suppression show subtle evidence of neurocognitive impairment compared to healthy controls, and increased immune activation appears to play a role. Additional studies are needed to develop strategic interventions beyond {cART} to potentially improve neurocognitive performance and/or minimize further impairment in this vulnerable population. {ClinicalTrials}.gov Identifier: {NCT}01523496.},

            There is an increasing role for biological markers (biomarkers) in the understanding and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. The application of imaging biomarkers specifically for the in vivo investigation of neurodegenerative disorders has increased substantially over the past decades and continues to provide further benefits both to the diagnosis and understanding of these diseases. This review forms part of a series of articles which stem from the University College London/University of Gothenburg course “Biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases”. In this review, we focus on neuroimaging, specifically positron emission tomography ({PET}) and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), giving an overview of the current established practices clinically and in research as well as new techniques being developed. We will also discuss the use of machine learning ({ML}) techniques within these fields to provide additional insights to early diagnosis and multimodal analysis.},

	shorttitle = {{HIV}-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder},
	abstract = {Despite combined antiretroviral therapy ({cART}) limiting {HIV} replication to undetectable levels in the blood, people living with {HIV} continue to experience {HIV}-associated neurocognitive disorder ({HAND}). {HAND} is associated with neurocognitive impairment, including motor impairment, and memory loss. {HIV} has been detected in the brain within 8 days of estimated exposure and the mechanisms for this early entry are being actively studied. Once having entered into the central nervous system ({CNS}), {HIV} degrades the blood–brain barrier through the production of its gp120 and Tat proteins. These proteins are directly toxic to endothelial cells and neurons, and propagate inflammatory cytokines by the activation of immune cells and dysregulation of tight junction proteins. The {BBB} breakdown is associated with the progression of neurocognitive disease. One of the main hurdles for treatment for {HAND} is the latent pool of cells, which are insensitive to {cART} and prolong inflammation by harboring the provirus in long-lived cells that can reactivate, causing damage. Multiple strategies are being studied to combat the latent pool and {HAND}; however, clinically, these approaches have been insufficient and require further revisions. The goal of this paper is to aggregate the known mechanisms and challenges associated with {HAND}.},

            Despite treatment, immune activation is thought to contribute to cerebral injury in children perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}). We aimed to characterize immune activation in relation to neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes. We therefore measured immunological, coagulation, and neuronal biomarkers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) samples of 34 perinatally {HIV}-infected children aged 8–18 years, and in plasma samples of 37 controls of comparable age, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. We then compared plasma biomarker levels between groups, and explored associations between plasma/{CSF} biomarkers and neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes using network analysis. {HIV}-infected children showed higher plasma levels of C-reactive protein, interferon-gamma, interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 than controls. In {HIV}-infected participants, plasma soluble {CD}14 was positively associated with microstructural white matter ({WM}) damage, and plasma D-dimer was negatively associated with {WM} blood flow. In {CSF}, {IL}-6 was negatively associated with {WM} volume, and neurofilament heavy-chain ({NFH}) was negatively associated with intelligence quotient and working memory. These markers of ongoing inflammation, immune activation, coagulation, and neuronal damage could be used to further evaluate the pathophysiology and clinical course of cerebral and cognitive deficits in perinatally acquired {HIV}.},

              The combination of radiomics and diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) may have potential clinical value in the early stage of {HIV}‐associated neurocognitive disorders ({HAND}).
            
            
              Purpose
              To investigate the value of {DTI}‐based radiomics in the early stage of {HAND} in people living with {HIV} ({PLWH}).
            
            
              Study Type
              Retrospective.
            
            
              Population
              A total of 138 male {PLWH} were included, including 68 with intact cognition ({IC}) and 70 with asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment ({ANI}). Seventy healthy controls ({HCs}) were recruited for tract‐based spatial statistics ({TBSS}) analysis. All {PLWHs} were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio.
            
            
              Field Strength/Sequence
              A 3 T, single‐shot spin–echo echo planar imaging ({EPI}).
            
            
              Assessment
              The differences between the {PLWH} groups were compared using {TBSS} and region of interest ({ROI}) analysis. Radiomic features were extracted from the corpus callosum ({CC}) on {DTI} postprocessed images, including fractional anisotropy ({FA}), axial diffusivity ({AD}), mean diffusivity ({MD}), and radial diffusivity ({RD}). The performance of the radiomic signatures was evaluated by {ROC} curve analysis. The radiomic signature with the highest area under the curve ({AUC}) was combined with clinical characteristics to construct a nomogram. Decision curve analysis ({DCA}) was performed to evaluate the ability of different methods in discriminating {ANI}.

              Results
              The {ANI} group showed lower {FA} and higher {AD} than the {IC} group. In the validation cohort, the {AUCs} of the {FA}‐, {AD}‐, {MD}‐ and {RD}‐based radiomic signatures and the clinicoradiomic nomogram were 0.829, 0.779, 0.790, 0.864, and 0.874, respectively. {DCA} revealed that the nomogram was of greater clinical value than {TBSS} analysis, the clinical models, and the {RD}‐based radiomic signature.
            
            
              Data Conclusion
              The combination of {DTI} and radiomics is correlated with early stage of {HAND} in {PLWH}.

              Background
              Chronic immune activation in the blood and central nervous system is a consequence of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection that contributes to disease morbidity and can occur despite virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy ({ART}). The trajectory of {HIV}-related inflammation may vary with the timing of {ART} initiation. We examined immune activation markers in cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and blood specimens collected over 96 weeks from participants who initiated {ART} during acute {HIV} infection ({AHI}).
            
            
              Methods
              {RV}254/{SEARCH}010 study participants with {AHI} underwent {CSF} (n = 89) and plasma (n = 146) sampling before initiating {ART} and at weeks 24 and 96 of treatment. A majority participants (64.4\%) received a standard {ART} regimen (hereafter, “standard {ART}”), with some (34.7\%) also receiving maraviroc and raltegravir for the first 24 weeks (hereafter, “{ART} plus”). We compared neopterin, {CXCL}10, {CCL}2, and interleukin 6 ({IL}-6) levels in the {AHI} group to those in 18 healthy, uninfected controls.
            
            
              Results
              Following 24 and 96 weeks of treatment, levels of all {CSF} markers normalized while levels of several plasma markers remained elevated in the {AHI} group (P {\textless} .001). Participants receiving the {ART}-plus regimen had lower median plasma {CCL}2 levels at week 24 and lower plasma neopterin levels at week 96.
            
            
              Conclusions
              {ART} initiation during {AHI} differentially impacts the brain compartment, with markers of inflammation returning to normal levels in the {CSF}, where they were sustained at week 96, but not in plasma.},

	abstract = {Background
              In the combination antiretroviral therapy era, {HIV}-associated neurocognitive disorder ({HAND}) is still widespread among {HIV}-infected individuals. However, there is no effective treatment for {HAND}, and the exact pathogenic mechanism of {HAND} remains unknown. This paper aims to provide a reference for further exploration in the field of {HAND} research.
            
            
              Methods
              We used {CiteSpace} software to collect 3057 articles related to {HAND} in the Web of Science Core Collection for comprehensive analysis. Betweenness centrality, count, and burst values were used as indicators in the visualization analysis, aiming to predict future new directions and cutting-edge trends.
            
            
              Results
              The last decade has been the peak period of {HAND} research, with the most prominent contributions by authors, countries, and institutions being Grant, Igor (135), the {USA} (2211), and the University of California System (758), respectively. The most frequently cited article is “{HIV}-associated neurocognitive disorders persist in the area of potent antiretroviral therapy: {CHARTER} Study.” The hotspots in this field are “neurocognitive impairment,” “central nervous system,” “cerebrospinal fluid,” “{HIV}-1 tat,” “{SIV},” “inflammation,” “infection,” and “pathogenesis.” The current research direction of {HAND} is focused on exploring the pathogenic mechanism underlying {HIV}-associated neurocognitive impairment and potential therapeutic targets.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study provides a bibliometric visualization of {HAND}-related literature to gain insight into the development and frontiers of this research field.

In addition to {CD}4, different gp120 isolates bind to the α- or β-chemokine receptors {CXCR}4 and {CCR}5, respectively. These and other chemokine receptors are on brain macrophages/microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Thus, apoptosis could occur via direct interaction of gp120 with neurons, indirectly via stimulation of glia to release neurotoxic factors, or via both pathways. Here we show in rat cerebrocortical cultures that recapitulate the type and proportion of cells normally found in brain, i.e., neurons, astrocytes, and macrophages/microglia, that the β-chemokines {RANTES} (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inflammatory protein ({MIP}-1β) protect neurons from gp120
              {SF}2
              -induced apoptosis. The gp120
              {SF}2
              isolate prefers binding to {CXCR}4 receptors, similar to the physiological α-chemokine ligands, stromal cell-derived factor ({SDF})-1α/β. {SDF}-1α/β failed to prevent gp120
              {SF}2
              neurotoxicity, and in fact also induced neuronal apoptosis. We could completely abrogate gp120
              {SF}2
              -induced neuronal apoptosis with the tripeptide {TKP}, which inhibits activation of macrophages/microglia. In contrast, {TKP} or depletion of macrophages/microglia did not prevent {SDF}-1 neurotoxicity. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ameliorated both gp120
              {SF}2
              - and {SDF}-1-induced neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that gp120
              {SF}2
              and {SDF}-1 differ in the cell type on which they stimulate {CXCR}4 to induce neuronal apoptosis, but both ligands use the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway for death signaling. Moreover, gp120
              {SF}2
              -induced neuronal apoptosis depends predominantly on an indirect pathway via activation of chemokine receptors on macrophages/microglia, whereas {SDF}-1 may act directly on neurons or astrocytes.},

            Despite successful antiretroviral drug therapy, a subset of human immunodeficiency virus-1 ({HIV})-positive individuals still display synaptodendritic simplifications and functional cognitive impairments referred to as {HIV}-associated neurocognitive disorders ({HANDs}). The neurological damage observed in {HAND} subjects can be experimentally reproduced by the {HIV} envelope protein gp120. However, the complete mechanism of gp120-mediated neurotoxicity is not entirely understood. Gp120 binds to neuronal microtubules and decreases the level of tubulin acetylation, suggesting that it may impair axonal transport. In this study, we utilized molecular and pharmacological approaches, in addition to microscopy, to examine the relationship between gp120-mediated tubulin deacetylation, axonal transport, and neuronal loss. Using primary rat cortical neurons, we show that gp120 decreases acetylation of tubulin and increases histone deacetylase 6 ({HDAC}6), a cytoplasmic enzyme that regulates tubulin deacetylation. We also demonstrate that the selective {HDAC}6 inhibitors tubacin and {ACY}-1215, which prevented gp120-mediated deacetylation of tubulin, inhibited the ability of gp120 to promote neurite shortening and cell death. We further observed by co-immunoprecipitation and confirmed with mass spectroscopy that exposure of neurons to gp120 decreases the association between tubulin and motor proteins, a well-established consequence of tubulin deacetylation. To assess the physiological consequences of this effect, we examined the axonal transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}). We report that gp120 decreases the velocity of {BDNF} transport, which was restored to baseline levels when neurons were exposed to {HDAC}6 inhibitors. Overall, our data suggest that gp120-mediated tubulin deacetylation causes impairment of axonal transport through alterations to the microtubule cytoskeleton.},

              Postmortem brains of patients diagnosed with {HIV}-1-associated neurocognitive disorders ({HAND}) exhibit loss of dendrites. However, the mechanisms by which synapses are damaged are not fully understood.
            
            
              Design:
              Dendrite length and remodeling occurs via microtubules, the dynamics of which are regulated by microtubule-binding proteins, including microtubule-associated protein 2 ({MAP}2). The {HIV} protein gp120 is neurotoxic and interferes with neuronal microtubules. We measured {MAP}2 concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and {MAP}2 immunoreactivity in rat cortical neurons exposed to {HIV} and gp120.
            
            
              Methods:
              First, we examined whether {HIV} affects {MAP}2 levels by analyzing the {CSF} of 27 persons living with {HIV} ({PLH}) whose neurocognitive performance had been characterized. We then used rat cortical neurons to study the mechanisms of {HIV}-mediated dendritic loss.
            
            
              Results:
              {PLH} who had {HAND} had greater {MAP}2 concentrations within the {CSF} than cognitive normal {PLH}. In cortical neurons, the deleterious effect of {HIV} on {MAP}2-positive dendrites occurred through a gp120-mediated mechanism. The neurotoxic effect of {HIV} was blocked by a {CCR}5 antagonist and prevented by Helix-A, a peptide that displaces gp120 from binding to microtubules, conjugated to a nanolipoprotein particle delivery platform.
            
            
              Conclusion:

            {ABSTRACT}
            {HIV} enters the central nervous system ({CNS}) during the early stages of infection and can cause neurological dysfunction, including neurodegeneration and neurocognitive impairment. The specific autophagy responsible for removal of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) and mitochondrial dynamics constitute neuronal mitochondrial quality control mechanisms and are impaired in neurodegenerative disorders and numerous other diseases. The release of {HIV} proteins gp120 and Tat from infected cells is thought to play an important role in {HIV}-associated neurocognitive disorders ({HAND}), but the mechanism(s) leading to impairment are poorly understood. Here, we report that exposure of human primary neurons ({HPNs}) to {HIV} gp120 and Tat accelerates the balance of mitochondrial dynamics toward fission (fragmented mitochondria) and induces perinuclear aggregation of mitochondria and mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 ({DRP}1), leading to neuronal mitochondrial fragmentation. {HIV} gp120 and Tat increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta ({LC}3B) protein and induced selective recruitment of Parkin/{SQSTM}1 to the damaged mitochondria. Using either a dual fluorescence reporter system expressing monomeric red fluorescent protein and enhanced green fluorescent protein targeted to mitochondria (mito-{mRFP}-{EGFP}) or a tandem light chain 3 ({LC}3) vector ({mCherry}-{EGFP}-{LC}3), both {HIV} proteins were found to inhibit mitophagic flux in human primary neurons. {HIV} gp120 and Tat induced mitochondrial damage and altered mitochondrial dynamics by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). These findings indicate that {HIV} gp120 and Tat initiate the activation and recruitment of mitophagy markers to damaged mitochondria in neurons but impair the delivery of mitochondria to the lysosomal compartment. Altered mitochondrial dynamics associated with {HIV} infection and incomplete neuronal mitophagy may play a significant role in the development of {HAND} and accelerated aging associated with {HIV} infection.
            
              {IMPORTANCE}
              Despite viral suppression by antiretrovirals, {HIV} proteins continue to be detected in infected cells and neurologic complications remain common in infected people.

              Introduction
              Immunological damage in acute {HIV} infection ({AHI}) may predispose to detrimental clinical sequela. However, studies on the earliest {HIV}-induced immunological changes are limited, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the plasma cytokines kinetics, and their associations with virological and immunological parameters, in a well-characterized {AHI} cohort where participants were diagnosed before peak viremia.
            
            
              Methods
              Blood cytokine levels were measured using Luminex and {ELISA} assays pre-infection, during the hyperacute infection phase (before or at peak viremia, 1–11 days after the first detection of viremia), after peak viremia (24–32 days), and during the early chronic phase (77–263 days). Gag-protease-driven replicative capacities of the transmitted/founder viruses were determined using a green fluorescent reporter T cell assay. Complete blood counts were determined before and immediately following {AHI} detection before {ART} initiation.
            
            
              Results
   Untreated {AHI} was associated with a cytokine storm of 12 out of the 33 cytokines analyzed. Initiation of {ART} during Fiebig stages I–{II} abrogated the cytokine storm. In untreated {AHI}, virus replicative capacity correlated positively with {IP}-10 (rho = 0.84,
                P

                P
                 {\textless} 0.001), decreased lymphocytes (
                P
                 = 0.011) and eosinophils (
                P
                 = 0.003) at Fiebig stages I–{II}, and decreased eosinophils (
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001) and basophils (
                P
                 = 0.007) at Fiebig stages {III}–V. Levels of {CXCL}13 during the untreated hyperacute phase correlated inversely with blood eosinophils (rho = − 0.89,
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001), basophils (rho = − 0.87,

                P
                 = 0.005), suggesting their trafficking into tissues. In early treated individuals, time to viral load suppression correlated positively with plasma {CXCL}13 at the early chronic phase (rho = 0.83,
                P
                 = 0.042).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              While commencement of {ART} during Fiebig stages I–{II} of {AHI} abrogated the {HIV}-induced cytokine storm, significant depletions of eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes, as well as transient expansions of monocytes, were still observed in these individuals in the hyperacute phase before the initiation of {ART}, suggesting that even {ART} initiated during the onset of viremia does not abrogate all {HIV}-induced immune changes.},

It is hypothesized that the critical events initiating this condition occur outside the brain, particularly in the peripheral blood. Diagnoses of {HIV}-induced neurocognitive disorders largely rely on neuropsychometric assessments, which are not precise. Total {HIV} {DNA} in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}), quantified by {PCR}, correlate with disease progression, which is a promising biomarker to predict {HAND}. Numerous {PCR} assays for {HIV} {DNA} in cell compartments are prone to variation due to the lack of standardization and, therefore, their utility in predicting {HAND} produced different outcomes. This review evaluates the clinical relevance of total {HIV} {DNA} in circulating mononuclear cells using different published quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) protocols. The rationale is to shed light on the most appropriate assays and sample types used to accurately quantify {HIV} {DNA} load, which predicts severity of neurocognitive impairment. The role of monocytes as a vehicle for trafficking {HIV} into the {CNS} makes it the most suitable sample for determining a {HAND} associated reservoir. Studies have also shown significant associations between monocyte {HIV} {DNA} levels with markers of neurodamage. However, {qPCR} assays using {PBMCs} are cheaper and available commercially, thus could be beneficial in clinical settings.
