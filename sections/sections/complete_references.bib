              Introduction
              Immunological damage in acute {HIV} infection ({AHI}) may predispose to detrimental clinical sequela. However, studies on the earliest {HIV}-induced immunological changes are limited, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the plasma cytokines kinetics, and their associations with virological and immunological parameters, in a well-characterized {AHI} cohort where participants were diagnosed before peak viremia.


              Methods
              Blood cytokine levels were measured using Luminex and {ELISA} assays pre-infection, during the hyperacute infection phase (before or at peak viremia, 1–11 days after the first detection of viremia), after peak viremia (24–32 days), and during the early chronic phase (77–263 days). Gag-protease-driven replicative capacities of the transmitted/founder viruses were determined using a green fluorescent reporter T cell assay. Complete blood counts were determined before and immediately following {AHI} detection before {ART} initiation.


              Results
   Untreated {AHI} was associated with a cytokine storm of 12 out of the 33 cytokines analyzed. Initiation of {ART} during Fiebig stages I–{II} abrogated the cytokine storm. In untreated {AHI}, virus replicative capacity correlated positively with {IP}-10 (rho = 0.84,
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001) and {IFN}-alpha (rho = 0.59,
                P
                 = 0.045) and inversely with nadir {CD}4
                +
                T cell counts (rho = − 0.58,
                P
                 = 0.048).

                T cell counts (rho = − 0.58,
                P
                 = 0.048). Hyperacute {HIV} infection before the initiation of {ART} was associated with a transient increase in monocytes (
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001), decreased lymphocytes (
                P
                 = 0.011) and eosinophils (
                P
                 = 0.003) at Fiebig stages I–{II}, and decreased eosinophils (
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001) and basophils (
                P
                 = 0.007) at Fiebig stages {III}–V. Levels of {CXCL}13 during the untreated hyperacute phase correlated inversely with blood eosinophils (rho = − 0.89,
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001), basophils (rho = − 0.87,
                P
                 = 0.001) and lymphocytes (rho = − 0.81,
                P
                 = 0.005), suggesting their trafficking into tissues. In early treated individuals, time to viral load suppression correlated positively with plasma {CXCL}13 at the early chronic phase (rho = 0.83,
                P
                 = 0.042).



              Conclusion
              While commencement of {ART} during Fiebig stages I–{II} of {AHI} abrogated the {HIV}-induced cytokine storm, significant depletions of eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes, as well as transient expansions of monocytes, were still observed in these individuals in the hyperacute phase before the initiation of {ART}, suggesting that even {ART} initiated during the onset of viremia does not abrogate all {HIV}-induced immune changes.},

              Background
              Chronic immune activation in the blood and central nervous system is a consequence of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection that contributes to disease morbidity and can occur despite virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy ({ART}). The trajectory of {HIV}-related inflammation may vary with the timing of {ART} initiation. We examined immune activation markers in cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and blood specimens collected over 96 weeks from participants who initiated {ART} during acute {HIV} infection ({AHI}).


              Methods
              {RV}254/{SEARCH}010 study participants with {AHI} underwent {CSF} (n = 89) and plasma (n = 146) sampling before initiating {ART} and at weeks 24 and 96 of treatment. A majority participants (64.4\%) received a standard {ART} regimen (hereafter, “standard {ART}”), with some (34.7\%) also receiving maraviroc and raltegravir for the first 24 weeks (hereafter, “{ART} plus”). We compared neopterin, {CXCL}10, {CCL}2, and interleukin 6 ({IL}-6) levels in the {AHI} group to those in 18 healthy, uninfected controls.


              Results
              Following 24 and 96 weeks of treatment, levels of all {CSF} markers normalized while levels of several plasma markers remained elevated in the {AHI} group (P {\textless} .001). Participants receiving the {ART}-plus regimen had lower median plasma {CCL}2 levels at week 24 and lower plasma neopterin levels at week 96.


              Conclusions
              {ART} initiation during {AHI} differentially impacts the brain compartment, with markers of inflammation returning to normal levels in the {CSF}, where they were sustained at week 96, but not in plasma.},

	abstract = {The pathogenesis of {HIV}-associated neurocognitive disorders is complex and multifactorial. It is hypothesized that the critical events initiating this condition occur outside the brain, particularly in the peripheral blood. Diagnoses of {HIV}-induced neurocognitive disorders largely rely on neuropsychometric assessments, which are not precise. Total {HIV} {DNA} in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}), quantified by {PCR}, correlate with disease progression, which is a promising biomarker to predict {HAND}. Numerous {PCR} assays for {HIV} {DNA} in cell compartments are prone to variation due to the lack of standardization and, therefore, their utility in predicting {HAND} produced different outcomes. This review evaluates the clinical relevance of total {HIV} {DNA} in circulating mononuclear cells using different published quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) protocols. The rationale is to shed light on the most appropriate assays and sample types used to accurately quantify {HIV} {DNA} load, which predicts severity of neurocognitive impairment. The role of monocytes as a vehicle for trafficking {HIV} into the {CNS} makes it the most suitable sample for determining a {HAND} associated reservoir. Studies have also shown significant associations between monocyte {HIV} {DNA} levels with markers of neurodamage. However, {qPCR} assays using {PBMCs} are cheaper and available commercially, thus could be beneficial in clinical settings. There is need, however, to standardise {DNA} extraction, normalisation and limit of detection.},

              and is therefore thought to contribute to {HIV}-associated dementia. In addition to {CD}4, different gp120 isolates bind to the α- or β-chemokine receptors {CXCR}4 and {CCR}5, respectively. These and other chemokine receptors are on brain macrophages/microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Thus, apoptosis could occur via direct interaction of gp120 with neurons, indirectly via stimulation of glia to release neurotoxic factors, or via both pathways. Here we show in rat cerebrocortical cultures that recapitulate the type and proportion of cells normally found in brain, i.e., neurons, astrocytes, and macrophages/microglia, that the β-chemokines {RANTES} (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inflammatory protein ({MIP}-1β) protect neurons from gp120

              isolate prefers binding to {CXCR}4 receptors, similar to the physiological α-chemokine ligands, stromal cell-derived factor ({SDF})-1α/β. {SDF}-1α/β failed to prevent gp120
              {SF}2
              neurotoxicity, and in fact also induced neuronal apoptosis. We could completely abrogate gp120
              {SF}2
              -induced neuronal apoptosis with the tripeptide {TKP}, which inhibits activation of macrophages/microglia. In contrast, {TKP} or depletion of macrophages/microglia did not prevent {SDF}-1 neurotoxicity. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ameliorated both gp120
              {SF}2
              - and {SDF}-1-induced neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that gp120
              {SF}2
              and {SDF}-1 differ in the cell type on which they stimulate {CXCR}4 to induce neuronal apoptosis, but both ligands use the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway for death signaling. Moreover, gp120
              {SF}2
              -induced neuronal apoptosis depends predominantly on an indirect pathway via activation of chemokine receptors on macrophages/microglia, whereas {SDF}-1 may act directly on neurons or astrocytes.},
