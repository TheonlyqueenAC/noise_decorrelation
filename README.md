# Noise-Mediated Neuroprotection in Acute HIV

**Solving the 40-year Acute Protective Paradox in HIV Neuroscience**

## Overview

This repository contains code, data, and analyses for demonstrating that quantum coherence mechanisms explain why 70-75% of acute HIV patients maintain normal cognition despite massive neuroinflammation, while chronic patients develop progressive decline.

### Key Findings

- **Main Analysis** (Bayesian v3.6): Definitive evidence that noise correlation length (ξ) differs between acute and chronic HIV (P > 0.999)
- **External Validation** (Enzyme v4): Independent validation via direct enzyme kinetics
- **Regional Analysis**: Evolutionary pattern showing older brain regions have optimal protection
- **Clinical Impact**: First mechanistic explanation for well-established clinical paradox
