1. Define SSE-focused scope and success criteria for Option B
- Clarify that Option B = SSE (stochastic dephasing noise) unraveling, avoiding full density matrix storage
- Success = ability to run current simulator with optional SSE dephasing, produce Γ_map overlays, and observe coherence decay matching Tegmark-order magnitudes
2. Add minimal open-systems scaffolding module (quantum/open_systems.py)
- Implement build_dephasing_map(r, z, T, medium, cytokine_phase, params) returning Γ_map with units notes
- Implement sse_dephasing_step(psi, Gamma_map, dt, rng) with white-noise dephasing consistent with Γ (Ito/Euler-Maruyama)
- Implement coherence_metrics_sse(psi) with simple diagnostics (norm check, entropy proxy, spatial correlation)
- Include docstrings with citations (Tegmark 2000; Haken–Strobl–Reineker; Breuer–Petruccione)
3. Extend simulator configuration to select dephasing model and parameters
- In script/microtubule_quantum_coherence_full_simulation.py add config keys: dephasing_model {"none","SSE_local","SSE_correlated"}, temperature_K, ionic_strength_M, dielectric_rel, gamma_scale_alpha, corr_length_xi
- Default to dephasing_model="none" to preserve current behavior
- Validate and store parameters in __init__ and _setup_parameters
4. Hook Option B into simulator lifecycle
- Add _setup_decoherence(): call build_dephasing_map and cache Γ_map and ξ
- In main time loop: after Hamiltonian step, call sse_dephasing_step when dephasing_model startswith "SSE"
- Ensure probability norm is preserved in expectation (renormalize per step if using phase-only dephasing)
5. Visualization and data outputs for Option B
- Save Γ_map to data directory; add overlay panels of Γ_map with |ψ|^2 snapshots
- Log coherence metrics over time; export JSON/CSV; add quick plots under figures_dir
6. Validation against Tegmark-style estimates
- Implement a small analysis script/notebook: for chosen Δx, temperature, and medium, compute expected dephasing rate Γ_Tegmark and compare to simulated decay constant
- Run across HIV phases mapping to Γ scaling; report half-life and variance bands from multiple SSE trajectories
7. Optional spatially correlated SSE (SSE_correlated)
- Introduce Gaussian noise kernel with correlation length ξ; generate correlated noise via FFT-based filtering or circulant embedding
- Compare coherence length and decay vs local SSE
8. Performance and stability safeguards
- Use vectorized operations for noise injection; ensure dt·Γ << 1; offer RNG seeding for reproducibility
- Provide small-grid demo config and convergence checklist (dt, N_r, N_z)
9. Tests and examples
- Add a smoke test that runs a short simulation with dephasing_model="SSE_local" and asserts monotonic increase of dephasing indicator and bounded norm
- Provide an example script in Extra demonstrating SSE toggle and saving outputs
10. Documentation updates
- Update project docs with an "Option B (SSE) Quickstart" and parameter explanations
11. Approval and next steps
- After roadmap approval, implement steps 2–5 first; then proceed with 6–9; 7 is optional stretch goal
12. Submit the roadmap deliverable
