Thank you for considering contributing to the Microtubule Simulation project! Your efforts will improve the quality, usability, and impact of our work. This guide outlines the steps for contributing, coding standards, testing procedures, and the submission process.

---

## 1. Getting Started

To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

### Fork the Repository
1. Go to the repository’s GitHub page.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner.
3. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Microtubule_Simulation.git

	4.	Navigate to the cloned directory:

cd Microtubule_Simulation



Create a Branch
	1.	Create a branch for your contribution:

git checkout -b feature-name


	2.	Use meaningful names for your branches (e.g., add-documentation, fix-bug-123, enhance-feature).

Install Dependencies
	1.	Ensure your environment is set up with the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	2.	If you encounter issues, refer to README.md or open an issue for help.

2. Coding Standards

To maintain consistency and quality across the codebase, follow these standards:

Follow PEP 8
	•	Use PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
	•	Example tools for checking style:

pip install flake8
flake8 your_file.py



Write Meaningful Commit Messages
	•	Use concise and descriptive messages:

git commit -m "Fix bug in coherence evolution visualization"



Document Your Code
	•	Use comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of your code.
	•	Example:

def combine_plots():
    """
    Combines individual plots into a single visualization.
    """
    pass



Maintain an Organized Directory Structure
	•	Place new scripts in appropriate directories (e.g., src/, tests/).
	•	Avoid duplicating functionality or creating unnecessary files.

3. Testing Your Code

Run Existing Tests
	•	If tests are included in the repository, run:

pytest



Write New Tests
	•	For new functionality, include unit tests in the tests/ directory.
	•	Use meaningful names for your test functions:

def test_quantum_coherence_plot():
    """
    Ensures that the plot generated matches expected output.
    """
    pass



Check Outputs
	•	If your code generates visualizations, verify that the plots are saved correctly and meet expectations.

4. Submitting Your Changes

Push Your Branch
	1.	Push your branch to your forked repository:

git push origin feature-name



Open a Pull Request
	1.	Go to the original repository.
	2.	Click the Pull Requests tab and select New Pull Request.
	3.	Provide a detailed description of your changes and the issue it addresses.

Address Feedback
	•	Be responsive to comments and suggestions from reviewers.
	•	Make necessary changes and update your pull request as needed.

5. Reporting Issues

If you encounter bugs or have ideas for new features, please report them by creating an issue:

Create a New Issue
	1.	Navigate to the repository’s Issues tab on GitHub.
	2.	Click New Issue and use a descriptive title.
	3.	Provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue or describe your feature request.

Include Context
	•	Add relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets to help others understand the problem.

6. Code of Conduct
