### Review of Newly Added Code for SSE Option B Plan

Date: 2025-10-17

Purpose
- Evaluate recently added modules for their usefulness to the SSE (stochastic Schrödinger equation) implementation plan (Option B), and recommend minimal, low-risk reuse/adaptation paths.

Scope of review
- script/Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3/wavefunction.py
- script/Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3/metrics.py
- script/Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3/hiv_quantum_stats.py
- Note: Additional similarly named modules exist in other legacy folders; this review focuses on the newly added instances referenced in VCS status.

Key findings and relevance to SSE
1) wavefunction.py (Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3)
- What it contains:
  - evolve_wavefunction: explicit time stepper that mixes kinetic, potential, and a phenomenological “Tegmark decoherence” factor (plus inflammation-dependent Γ).
  - calculate_potential: periodic/harmonic/wall/cytokine potential builder with cylindrical geometry awareness.
  - calculate_decoherence: maps HIV/condition strings to a spatially varying decoherence rate (Γ) with simple multiplicative scaling and optional “Fibonacci protection” modulation.
- Technical notes:
  - Uses cylindrical volume-element normalization (R·dr·dz·2π) and applies a Jacobian factor in evolution; consistent with our geometry considerations.
  - Decoherence is implemented as deterministic damping (−Γ·dt·ψ), not stochastic. This is not SSE but is directly useful for constructing Γ_map inputs for SSE.
- Benefit to SSE plan:
  - Good starting point for build_dephasing_map(r, z, T, medium, cytokine_phase, params): the condition handling and cytokine scaling patterns can be adapted to produce a Γ_map independent of dynamics.
  - Potential builder can be referenced to ensure consistent potentials when toggling SSE on/off.
- Recommendation: ADAPT
  - Extract the condition→α/Γ scaling patterns and geometry normalization ideas into quantum/open_systems.py:build_dephasing_map.
  - Do not reuse the evolution scheme; SSE will handle noise injection separately after the Hamiltonian step.

2) metrics.py (Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3)
- What it contains:
  - calculate_probability_density with optional cylindrical Jacobian correction.
  - calculate_coherence defined as overlap-based coherence proxy between current and initial states (with volume element).
  - calculate_dispersion_metrics including variance, entropy, kurtosis in cylindrical geometry.
- Technical notes:
  - The metrics correctly incorporate the cylindrical volume element R·dr·dz·2π.
  - Dependencies: numpy (and scipy.integrate, but not strictly necessary for the shown functions).
- Benefit to SSE plan:
  - Directly reusable for coherence_metrics_sse(psi): overlap-based coherence, dispersion, entropy proxies for logging and validation.
- Recommendation: USE-AS-IS (via thin shim)
  - Either import selected functions in quantum/open_systems.py with try/except, or replicate minimal logic if import path stability is a concern.
  - Prefer reuse to maintain a single definition of cylindrical-aware metrics.

3) hiv_quantum_stats.py (Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3)
- What it contains:
  - Appears to be an incomplete or pasted reporting snippet (references variables like temp, f, HAVE_STATSMODELS, self.data without definitions).
- Benefit to SSE plan:
  - None directly in its current form. It hints at reporting/analytics structure but is non-executable.
- Recommendation: DEFER
  - Do not integrate. If reporting is desired later, create a clean analysis utility that logs SSE dephasing fits and phase comparisons.

Mapping to Option B roadmap items
- 2. Add minimal open-systems scaffolding module
  - build_dephasing_map: Adapt calculate_decoherence logic (condition maps, α scaling) from wavefunction.py, and ensure units/temperature parameters are explicit.
  - sse_dephasing_step: Independent; not covered by new code (requires Ito/Euler–Maruyama noise injection).
  - coherence_metrics_sse: Reuse metrics.py functions (probability density with Jacobian, overlap-based coherence, dispersion/entropy).
- 3. Extend simulator configuration
  - The condition strings in calculate_decoherence align with hiv_phase already present; reuse the mappings to parameterize Γ scaling.
- 5. Visualization and outputs
  - Use metrics from metrics.py to log coherence over time and save Γ_map snapshots for overlays.

Concrete reuse/adaptation proposals
- In quantum/open_systems.py (planned):
  - from script.Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3.metrics import calculate_probability_density, calculate_coherence as coherence_overlap
  - Implement coherence_metrics_sse(psi, psi0, R, dr, dz) that calls the above and aggregates dispersion metrics.
  - Implement build_dephasing_map(r, z, params) by adapting calculate_decoherence’s phase scaling and removing any evolution-side assumptions; ensure temperature_K, ionic_strength_M, dielectric_rel, gamma_scale_alpha inputs are accepted and documented.

Risk and compatibility
- Paths: The new files are in script/Tegmarks_Cat_source_code_3; ensure stable import paths or copy minimal logic if path volatility is expected.
- Units: New modules are mostly dimensionless; our open-system layer must document SI units and scaling factors; start with dimensionless scaling consistent with current simulator and annotate conversions for later refinement.
- Redundancy: Avoid duplicating Laplacian/evolution code; keep SSE concerns isolated to quantum/open_systems.py.

Prioritized recommendations
- Use-as-is (via shim): metrics.py (coherence and dispersion functions)
- Adapt: wavefunction.py’s calculate_decoherence logic and cylindrical normalization ideas to build_dephasing_map
- Defer: hiv_quantum_stats.py (malformed snippet; not actionable)

Next steps
- Implement thin wrappers in quantum/open_systems.py to consume metrics.py and to construct Γ_map using adapted logic from wavefunction.py.
- Wire hooks into script/microtubule_quantum_coherence_full_simulation.py as per the Option B roadmap (config gating and SSE step call).
